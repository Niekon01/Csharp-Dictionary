# Project Documentation – Dictionary Application 
## Problem Statement 

Develop a console application in C# that takes a word from user, and prints the meaning, synonym and antonym of the word based on user’s choice. 

## Explanation 

The aim of the assignment is to create an application that works like a digital dictionary. The user can input a word and then choose from a list of menus whether they want the meaning of the word as it is defined in the dictionary, the synonyms, or the antonyms of the word. 

The application should take the word and the choice of the user and give them the desired output. 

## API 
I have decided to use Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus (https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus) as my external API for this project. 

## Design Considerations 

The design of the application is prepared based on the SOLID principles.
